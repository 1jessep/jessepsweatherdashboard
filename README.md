# jessepsweatherdashboard


This is my submission for the Weather Dashbaord module 6 challenge. 
Students were asked to code a weather dashboard that allows user to search any city and display current day/5 day future weather forecast. 
Currently this webpage is not 100% complete. The site is fully functional but a list of previously searched cities is not displayed under the search bar. 
I plan on returning to this app down the road and finding a solution. Also when the user clicks the link to visit the webpage, portions of the blue boxes 
for future forecast are shown (dont like the way that looks and plan on fixing) Only when the user searches for a city then all the info is displayed properly.

Attached is a link to the deployed applicatin: https://1jessep.github.io/jessepsweatherdashboard/

Attached is a screenshot of current application after user searches for a city:
